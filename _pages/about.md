# Shun Zhang

Welcome to the homepage of Shun Zhang (in Simplified Chinese: 张舜)!

I am a research scientist at the [MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab](https://mitibmwatsonailab.mit.edu/), while I am based in the Bay Area. My research interests lie in **reinforcement learning**, **large language models**, and **[value alignment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_alignment)**.

I obtained my Ph.D. from the University of Michigan, where I was advised by Prof. [Satinder Singh](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~baveja/) and Prof. [Ed Durfee](https://durfee.engin.umich.edu/). Prior to that, I received both my B.S. and M.S. in computer science from the University of Texas at Austin, where I conducted my undergraduate and master's research under the guidance of Prof. [Peter Stone](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pstone/) and Prof. [Dana Ballard](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~dana/).

My CV in [HTML](/cv/) and [PDF](/pdfs/shun-zhang-cv.pdf).
