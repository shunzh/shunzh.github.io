Hi! This is Shun Zhang (张舜). I am a senior GenAI engineer on the [NVIDIA Cosmos](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai/cosmos/) team.

My research interests lie in **reinforcement learning (RL)** and **language models**.
I am interested in **RL-inspired self-evolving agents** that plan, acquire reusable skills, and improve through interaction.
I am also interested in **value alignment**, particularly enabling agents to proactively infer and adapt to human users' goals rather than reactively following instructions.
