# Shun Zhang

Hi! This is Shun Zhang (张舜).
My research interests lie in **reinforcement learning**, **large language models**, and **value alignment**.

I received my Ph.D. from the University of Michigan, advised by Prof. [Satinder Singh](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~baveja/) and Prof. [Ed Durfee](https://durfee.engin.umich.edu/).
Prior to that, I received both my B.S. and M.S. in computer science from the University of Texas at Austin, working on research advised by Prof. [Peter Stone](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pstone/) and Prof. [Dana Ballard](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~dana/).
I have spent time at the [MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab](https://mitibmwatsonailab.mit.edu/) and [Asari AI](https://asari.ai/).

My CV in [HTML](/cv/) and [PDF](/pdfs/shun-zhang-cv.pdf).
